January 2020 Meeting Notes:

Last Brewer Standing competition

Buddy will be running a competition this year.  Big thanks to Zach Snider for all the work he did on this last year.

See attached for a copy of the rules

If you have a question or concern please email to competition@scuba.beer 

We will be posting the leader board on our scuba.beer website

If you weren't at the meeting and would like to participate please let us know no later than Friday January 17th.  You can reply to this email and let us know and just indicate whether you are an extract or all-grain brewer.



Education Presentation

Andrew Lechowitz went over setting up an equipment profile in BeerSmith 2.

Need to see if we can get the notes on the website for this

A motion was made to spend $40 on a hop aroma kit from Yakima Valley Hops for education.  Motion passed unanimously

Social Events

Sunday, January 12th at 11:00 AM at Grape and Grains there will be an all-grain brew day to inform people about all-grain brewing.  They will be brewing a Blonde Stout for St. Patrick's Day (dying it green then too).

A motion was made and passed to do the raffle again this year ($50 gift card to G&G) starting at next month's meeting (February) and drawing the prize at the December meeting.  So remember any time you bring anything to share (food or drink) to sign the sheet to get registered.

Social Media/Webpage

Last year's last Brewer Standing competitor's please send your recipes into andrew@scuba.beer so they can be put on the website.

What to do section

A question was asked about a Ginger Snap Imperial Stout, didn't seem to get any ginger flavor from the cookies added.  It was suggested to add fresh or dehydrated ginger in the fermentor or at the end of the boil (maybe 5-10 minutes remaining) to get more of the ginger taste in beer.

T-shirts

We have t-shirts now!  Big shout out to Adam Daughhetee for working on this. Shirts are included in your membership fee so make sure

you are current. If you didn't pick yours up at the last meeting they will be at the next.

Other Announcements

Kevin Smith (last year's winner in LBS) is selling a year old 7-gallon mash tun, paid $100 for it looking to get $50 out.  If interested email Kevin (kevinsmith610@gmail.com)

Congratulations to Zach and Alyssa Day on their recent nuptials

If you haven't paid your dues yet it is $15 (until June then $30) and you can pay via PayPal by sending dues to scupstatebrewers@gmail.com.  You can also pay Christy Gillespie at any of the meetings as well.  



Also, if you know of someone who isn't getting our emails please let us know so we can check our distribution list.



Thanks,



Buddy
