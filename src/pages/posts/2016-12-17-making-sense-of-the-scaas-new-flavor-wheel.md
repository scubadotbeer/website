ad excellent turnout for our Thanksgiving holiday party, big thanks to Christy Gillespie and Bill Fox for coordinating the event and John for the turkey.  After we all had gotten our food we had a short meeting consisting of the following.

T-shirts

Adam Daughhetee trying to get hold of Jessica Harrell to get image to have these available in December.  Shirts are included in your membership fee so make sure you are current.  Also make sure to check the sheets at the meeting so we have the right size for you and so we can order enough of each size to cover the group.

Last Brewer Standing

Finals for the Last Brewer Standing competition to be held at our December 12th meeting.   Andrew Lechowicz and Kevin Smith have to brew a Christmas beer.  After deliberating a bit they choose to do a Doppelbock which is a German beer traditional brewed for festivals (including Christmas).  If you are not familiar with this style some good commercial examples are Ayinger Celebrator, Spaten-Franziskaner Brau Optimator, or Paulaner Brauerei Salvator (German examples, I believe you can get these at Total Wine in the import section) also Bell's Brewing Company Consecrator or Troeggs Brewing Company Troegenator (US examples).
