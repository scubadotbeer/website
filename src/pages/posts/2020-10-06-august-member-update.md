I hope everyone is doing well.  The officers met in an online meeting and discussed quite a few topics.  The most impactful result of this meeting is that SCUBA has good news and bad news to share.

The bad news:  August meeting has once again been cancelled due to COVID-19.
  
The good news: 
(1) Starting September we will be meeting in small groups and 
(2) SCUBA has a home brew sharing plan in the works with a "leave a bottle, take a bottle" style.  Both should be able to be accomplished with relative safety for everyone and more information will be coming as we finalize details.

In other news, it was voted that large meetings or social events have been suspended until it is considered safe to meet in large groups.  Unfortunately, this suspension includes the Last Brewer Standing competition.  Buddy has done a great job planning this competition, and he will provide details the next time we're able to safely meet as a group again as to how we can pick up where we left off or start fresh.  Saddened as we are, it simply is not feasible in the current pandemic environment to meet and be in close contact with everyone, especially while sharing beverages.  It was also voted that for now, membership dues are also suspended.  

As everything is being held in suspense, we will be discussing the voting of new officers during our small group meetings in September, and each officer in charge of that particular meeting will get a vote on how everyone is feeling in regards to how we proceed.  In the meantime, please consider us all your interim officers and feel free to reach out if you need anything.  If you would like to be considered for an officer position, don't hesitate to reach out and let us know - voting will eventually take place somehow and everyone is welcome to put their name forward for an officer position!

If you have any favorite recipes, favorite yeasts or starters, or similar conversations or posts, we'd love to hear them!  Please visit our Facebook page, or email andrew@scuba.beer and get them online.  Several of you have made beers that I'd love to have the recipe for!  Our Web Page is a great place to share these, so please don't be shy!

These are unique times, but we'll make it through and be stronger for it in the end.  As always - stay safe everyone, and if things get to be too much, take a break and brew!
