Well, we waited until the last minute hoping our June meeting could still happen, but it looks like it won’t be possible.  The CDC is still recommending social distancing and while restaurants and bars have been allowed to reopen, they too are being asked to follow CDC guidelines.
The officers and I have talked and feel that for the safety of everyone, we must cancel our June meeting.  We are now hoping to meet in July.  What this means for SCUBA members:

* Voting for new officers will now be held in July instead of June. 
* As July starts our SCUBA year, dues will be owed at that point.  The officers and I will be looking at our financial status and discussing recommended amounts due to all the missed meetings, but the final answer on dues will come from new officers per our club guidelines.
* Buddy will be sending out new competition recipes to everyone along with instructions on how to handle the competition beer that should have been voted on in May.
* We will draw a raffle ticket for the free growler refill from May’s raffle and contact the winner directly.  

We will also be making a post to the group Facebook page and Website.
I know this is not the news I had hoped to give this month or that you hoped to hear.  As much as I wish we could meet again, we are a large club and everyone’s safety must come first.
Grape & Grains is open to fill recipes and provide supplies and Shoeless Brewing still has beer to go. Simply call ahead or email them and they can help get whatever you need ready for pick up.
