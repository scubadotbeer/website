Had excellent turnout for our Christmas holiday party, big thanks to Jim and Jennifer Baxter for coordinating the event and to everyone who brought something to share.  The pink elephant exchange was also a big success and was a great amount of fun.



**Last Brewer Standing:**

Zach Snider explained the competition and the style profile for the doppelboch was read.  After the dust cleared from the voting our inaugural winner in the Last Brewer Standing is Kevin Smith.  Congratulations to both Kevin and Andrew Lechowicz for getting to the finals.  

With all the options available, it was voted earlier in the year that the winner would select a custom prize (such as an engraved growler or customized tap handle) and SCUBA will pay

 up to $60 for the prize.  The winner must include the following details in the customization: The club name (or acronym SCUBA), the competition name, 2019 Champion, and their own name. It was also voted that we would look into getting a plaque for the wall

 at Shoeless with an engraved tag or name plate for the winner's name to be posted.



**Raffle drawing:**

Remember when you bring something to share (whether food or drink) to sign the raffle sheet, we will be putting all the names in and drawing for a $50 gift certificate to Grape & Grains at our end of the year meeting.

This year's winner was Anastasia Lambour.



**Dues:**

If you haven't paid your dues yet it is $30 and you can pay via PayPal by sending dues to scupstatebrewers@gmail.com.  You can also pay Christy Giilespie at any of the meetings as well.

**T-shirts**

Due to some design issues hopefully these will be available in January.

**Education:**

The following ideas have been submitted so far:

Yeast-Brian Daughhetee volunteered to give a recap of what he learns after visiting White Labs.

Grains-Which ones you can't steep and how to adjust recipes for them.

Yeast-creating and using slants for storage.

**Social Events**

If you know of any social events going on please share them on Facebook or send them to scupstatebrewers@gmail.com so we can publish.

Big hand to Andrew Lechowicz for all the great social events in the last 6 months.

**Social Media/Webpage**

Andrew Thompson reported that the website is up but in need of recipes and photos,

 if you have any ideas or recipes you would like to put on it please contact him at andrew@scuba.beer.

All the brewers that participated in the Last Brewer Standing competition please send their recipes to Andrew so he can publish on the site.

And finally remember our next meeting is January 9th, hope to see everyone there!



Thanks,

Buddy

VP SCUBA
