**2020 Last Brewer Standing Rules:**

I.	General:

\    a.	Brewers will be assigned a base malt, caramelized malt, and a cereal adjunct.  They will then be able to choose optional ingredients to fill out the grain bill.  Two identical assignments will be made so two people will compete against each other for votes.  Excluding hops, finings, and water treatments, a maximum of 6 ingredients per beer (base malt, caramelized malt, cereal adjunct, roasted malt, yeast, adjunct).

\    b.	After each competition the competitors and ingredients will be randomized again, it will always be at least two competitors per set of ingredients. 

\    c.	Because of the nature of extracts, extract brewers will go against another extract brewer and all grain brewers will compete against each other until the finals.

\    d.	Rules will be posted on the website (http://scuba.beer) and be at the counter of Grape and Grains.  Any questions or clarifications can be sent to competition@scuba.beer

III.	Scoring:

\    i.	This will ensure more heavily/lightly attended meetings or members missing stations will not affect scoring

\    ii.	Example if 26 people score at a station and beer A gets 15 votes and beer B gets 11, the brewer of beer A will get 58 points (15/26) and the brewer of beer B will get 42 points (11/26)

\    b.	Each competitors score will accumulate over the competitions and the totals will be posted to a leader board that will be available on the website.

\    c.	If one competitor at a stations beer runs out the scoring will stop at that station (the other’s beer can still be sampled but no extra votes given)

IV.	Timing:

\    a.	Competition and rules will be announced in January.  All interested members at the meeting will receive their required ingredients.  All other members will be notified via email and have 1 week to register and receive their required ingredients.

\    b.	Competitions will take place in March, May, July, and September.  Votes will be tallied, and the leader board updated at these meetings and the next set of round of the competition will be set.

\    c.	In September, the top 3 on the leaderboard will proceed to the final competition, held in December for a chance at the title of Last Brewer Standing.  All previous votes will be zeroed out and a pure vote will determine the winner.

V.	Competitions:

\    a.	Bring enough beer for people to sample (I would say minimum of 44 oz)

\    b.	Bring your recipe (never know if you have a catchy name might swing the voters)

\    c.	Be creative and have fun
