## T-shirts
T-shirts are in.  Remember if you are a paid member of the club this is part of your dues.  Please see one of the officers to pick up.  Another big thanks to Adam Daughhetee for doing this for the club.

## Last Brewer Standing competition
1st competition is next month
We have 18 brewers participating (12 all grain, 6 extract)
Please bring your entry in a plain bottle or growler (some people have very recognizable growlers)
Make sure you bring your recipe, can be just simple with grain percentages, hops amount and times, yeast and brewing notes.
If you are not able to be at the meeting drop of your entry and recipe at Grape and Grains sometime before
Points will be given on a percentage basis.  Example would be if 20 people judge two beers and beer A received 12 votes and beer B received 8, beer A would get 60 points and beer B would get 40
We will also be drawing ingredients and teams for round 2 at this meeting for the next competition in May
If you have a question please email to competition@scuba.beer

## Education Presentation
Evan Daigle gave an excellent presentation on using coffee in beer for the group here are a couple take-aways from the presentation:
Good ratio to start with is 1 oz. beans by weight to 1 gallon of beer
Use 5 oz water to 1 oz beans when steeping
The lighter the roast the brighter the character
Most of what is bought in the store is darker roast
When using coffee concentrates realize no two brands are the same
Don't use in boil, better to brew and add to secondary
if you steep hot it will give it a bright character
if you steep cold it will give it a dark character
Coffee like hops adds bitterness and the more fines you leave will increase the bitterness over time
Coffee oxidizes
Added three different roasts of coffee to the same stout to show the differences
Full presentation will be on our website http://scuba.beer
