Sparge: Fly sparge with 0.81 gal water at 168.0 F
Notes:
------
Originally had 9 oz of melanoidan in recipe only had 5 oz so add 4 oz of Opal 44

Added citric acid to water at beginning I think I should have done this during boil, also added 3/4 teaspoon of Latic acid (just a little over what it called for)

Crushed grains approx. .035

Heated mash tun twice to get to temp (filled left 10 minutes, drained and reheated water, then filled again for 10 minutes and drained.), use bag for grains

Mash started at 150 dropped to 148 added a cold bottle of water to get it down some

Got up to 152 drained some reheated and got it to 155

Let sit at 168 10 minutes

Added hops at 60 minutes rather than 45 by mistake.  Used regular centennial for bittering, used 2 oz cryo centennial for dry hop.

Into the fermentor around 2:00 PM at 82 degrees

One can of propper starter/1 bottle of water for Independance yeast then on the stir plate for 22 hours.

Pitched yeast into fermentor morning of 8/12 at 68 degrees

Bubbling away evening of 8/12

Fermenting wort is really think, could not get an accurate reading on evening of 8/12 or 8/13.

Morning of 8/14 krazen had pushed all liquid out of overflows

Added 2 oz of 14.1% centennial hops for dry hopping 8/14 6 PM

Turned chamber down to 30.5 degrees morning of 8/22

into the keg on 8/28 and put on regular gas pressure
